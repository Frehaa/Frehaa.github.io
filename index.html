    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <div id="about-self">
        My name is Frederik Haagensen. I am an enjoyer of videogames, anime,
        manga, programming, and playing piano. I also have a big interest in
        education, though I studied computer science at university. I finished
        my Ph.D. in computer science in October of 2025. I have spent in total 8
        months doing volunteer work in Japan, 5 of these at a private joined
        middle/high school. This experience has envigorated my interest in 
        education which is why I am currently working towards a life as a
        teacher.
        <br><br>
        As mentioned above, I enjoy programming so I develop all kinds of small 
        projects. Below is a hodgepodge of various projects I have worked on.
        Most of these are either small prototypes or work in progress. Common 
        for many of them is that they have to do with graphics, animation, 
        education, or game systems. I have an interest in developping my own 
        game, but instead of doing the sensible thing of using an existing game
        engine, I instead want to learn about the intrinsic details of how such
        a game engine works. So, I like developing most stuff myself as a
        learning experience.

                    this page, I think one of my next projects should be to
                    figure out how to display all of this in a more beautiful
                    manner and make this page not so pre-2000.

                                contains many different sub-projects for learning about 
                                different ways of doing 3D graphics. The most recent 
                                stuff is about using WebGL.

                                Project on making a tool for practicing piano using MIDI
                                files. The goal is to allow a user to practice sections 
                                and parts in a focused manner. Some standard practice 
                                exercises would also be ideal.  Initially inspired by

                                I worked on this when I made a MIDI parser. It was very useful 
                                to see the content of a MIDI file byte-by-byte. I could have 
                                used an existing visualizer, but making my own seemed both 
                                trivial and fun. Having my own visualizer also allows to make 
                                any kind of extension that I would want.

                                The page shows a single curve with 6 control points 
                                which are all used to calculate the points of the curve.
                                The curve can be drawn at many intermediate steps using 
                                the bottom slider. There is also code for drawing a 
                                qubic spline, though the draw call is commented out on line 365.

                                This project was about visualizing noise and different 
                                generators of noise. The most simple being white noise 
                                and a naive blue noise generator. I never got to
                                implementing other noise generators for the page, but
                                have experience implementing some for a Ray Tracer
                                project in F#. The page also uses a custom linear
                                congruential generator since I wanted control over the
                                randomness. A user of the page can write a different
                                random generator or change the parameters to see how it
                                affects the generated points. Though the blue noise
                                generator only updates previously generated points when
                                the seed is changed. And a bad generator may cause the
                                page to freeze since it cannot generate a point for the
                                blue noise generator.

                                This project was for generating graphs for the
                                3-coloring problem.  The goal was for the graphs to be
                                printable and colorable such that e.g. kids could try to
                                solve them. Besides some work on the presentation, the
                                only thing it really needs is random generation, some
                                suggested graphs, and automatically made solutions to
                                verify against.

                                This project was an attempt at understanding how to create 
                                an animation framework like Manim. It has some simple functionality 
                                like drawing a circle, moving it, and fading it, but nothing fancy.
                                The most interesting part is how to parse the instructions into 
                                something which can be animated.

                                Ambitious work on making a rogue-like RTS game.  Making
                                pathfinding and collision detection properly work has
                                been the biggest issue for progress here.

                                A fun little work in progress project on creating an
                                alternative alphabet for hiragana which uses some base
                                shapes for the vowel sounds and combines with other
                                shapes for consonant sound.

    The most finished projects here are the slideshows I made for various 
                    occasions. These are developed in Javascript, instead of something like 
                    Powerpoint, because I wanted to have more control, and a more interactive 
                    experience, than what static slides can provide. I believe this also 
                    stems from my interest in education and wanting to present and explain 
                    a topic in what I believe to be the most easily understandable way.

                                This slideshow was made for my Ph.D. defence. It
                                uses as a base some of the slides from the
                                saddlepoint slideshow, but expands on it for the 
                                specific slideshows I made.
