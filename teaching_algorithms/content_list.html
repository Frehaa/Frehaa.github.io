What things do I want to cover?

What are algorithms? Simply explained
Why are algorithms? Why is "problem solving" treated as its own big thing?
How? 
(Who?)
(When?)
(Where?)

I want to talk about sorting.
How much? Selection, Insertion, Merge, quicksort. Any more? Sorting networks? Parallel sorting? 
When covering an algorithm. How should it be taught? With exercises? 
Sorting in general? 
What does that mean? Introduction to partial orders, total orders, lattices? 

If talking about merge sort, I think it is good to introduce the world of divide and conquer.
What is the best way to introduce a divide and conquer algorithm? The phone book? Or maybe just searching for a keyword in a general list? Maybe introducing divide and conquer through merge sort is fine/best?


Data structures.
What is a data structure? How to structure data in a way which makes something easier to do? 
Array / sorted array
Linked lists (sorted array vs linked list)
Heap
trees / Union find

Abstract Data Structure.


Graphs
Spanning trees
Searching / paths
