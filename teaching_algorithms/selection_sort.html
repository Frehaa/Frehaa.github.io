Selection Sort is perhaps one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The idea
behind the algorithm is simply to search for the smallest element in the 
list, put it in the first position, then find the second smallest element 
and put it in its position and so on. 

This can be described in code as follows. We have two loops nested. The first
loop goes through every possible position i = (0, ..., n-1) in the list. The
second loop searches for element element to put in that position. After we have
found the smallest element and put it in its place (i = 0), when we need to find
the element to put in the next position (i = 1), we simply need to find the
smallest element again, excluding the the previous position we have already
finished. 

It should be clear that Selection Sort is correct, since after each iteration of
the outer loop, every element in places smaller than i has to be in the correct 
place. We say than Selection Sort maintains the "invariant" that every k &lt; i 
is in the correct position. Note how swap is only used to move an element into 
the position where it is going to stay. 

The running time of Selection Sort might be a bit tricky the first time you see
it. We can try to count the number of comparisons between elements in the list. 
Let us say the list contains n elements, the first iteration of the outer loop
(i = 0), j goes from 1 to n-1, so that is n - 2 comparisons, in the next
iteration of the outer loop, j goes from 2 to n-1, so that is n - 3 comparisons.
This continous until j = n - 1 and there is just 1 comparison. So if we sum these 
up we get (n - 2) + (n - 3) + (n - 4) + ... + 1. This is just summing the numbers 
from 1 to n-2.
