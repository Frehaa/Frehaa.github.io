    You may have heard about algorithms in relation to social media before, e.g. "The YouTube Algorithm", or just "The algorithm". Users and content creators on social media platform may talk about "The algorithm" in some vague mysterious terms, but what is this algorithm, and how does it relate to the definition in section 1? 

    In order to create and kind of social media app, many different algorithms are in play, but the algorithm that users and content creators are concerned with is just a "Sorting algorithm". Or to be more precise, it is the algorithm which determines the relative importance of content before it is sorted. Any kind of social media has a lot of content that it wants to show the users. Usually, they want to show content which keeps the user most engaged with the platform. In order to do this, the platform will want to rank content in a way which increases the likelyhood that a user will spend more time on the platform. This ranking of content is what people refer to when talking about "the algorithm". Users may want a say in how the ranking of content is done in order to protect themselves from being taken advantage of, and content creators want to know how to maximize the likelihood that their content is seen by as many people as possible.  
   
    I won't go into much detail on how this ranking is done, since I do not know the specifics and it probably varies between different platforms. But you can generally think of it as a statistical approach. From people watching a lot of content in the past, and analyzing what content people engage the most with, some predictions (as well as how well the content has done so far) are made on new content on whether or not it will capture people's interest.
