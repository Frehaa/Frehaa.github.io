/*
To put it simple, an algorithm is a series of instructions. Given some input, if you follow the instructions of the algorithm, you get an output. 
This can be compared to a food recipe. Given some ingredients, if you follow the instructions of the recipe, you get a finished dish (hopefully as advertised). 

Image of simple algorithm process: Input arrow to "Algorithm" arrow to output. 
Give a concrete example with food ingredients. 
Give a concrete example with sorting
    5 words unsorted -> 5 words sorted

Side note: You may have heard the word "algorithm" used in reference to YouTube,
Twitter, Facebook, or other social media. In these cases, "the algorithm" refers
to an algorithm for deciding what to show a user.

Why do we study algorithms?
1. Solve problems soundly and completely
2. Solve problems quickly
(3. Solve problems efficiently)
(4. Solve problems fairly?)
