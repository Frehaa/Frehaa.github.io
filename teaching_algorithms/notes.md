What are my thoughts to how to do this online course?

# Brainstorm

Start explaining what algorithms are

First "big" algorithm should probably be sorting since it is very easy to relate to
Furthermore, since people may have heard of "the algorithm" from the TV or the internet in relation to YouTube, I want to explain what that means without going into detail. So the explanation for the YouTube algorithm should be short. 

Explain modelling? 
One idea is to have some footnotes or words which I can explain in more detail if needed, but detracts from the core thing. 
So what is the core idea here. I want the main thing I want to explain to focus on that thing, but if there are other things which may need explaining then I think it is valuable to allow a student to dive into detail

Do I want a how to follow the course.
Maybe. I think it might be valueable, but it should be limited to a couple of bullet point take aways. 

Compare algorithms to recipes 

black box which takes some input and produces some output 

First small algorithm can be multiplication? 



## How to explain what algorithms are

Start with the brain training quiz. Have students think about how to solve do it.
